I have always been curious about everything around me, so I decided to learn data science and it's tools (not every single one of them, since that's a "little bit" overwhelming - I'll get there, though). I'm a true lifeong learner.

Analyzing, wrangling and visualizing data is the most efficient AND FUN way to learn about stuff. 

As an experienced lawyer (now turned programmer), I developed a fast-pacing critical thinking and efficient problem-solving skills.

Those skills, along with my ability to learn, will prove to be efficient in this new endeavor of mine.

*Background in: Python, Statistics, Machine Learning and Java.*
